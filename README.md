1. **Project Foundation & Data Structure Design**
   - WHY: Before writing any code, we need to understand how we'll store and manage our data
   - HOW:
     * Design the JSON structure that will hold our tasks
     * Plan how we'll generate unique IDs
     * Think about date handling for created/updated timestamps
   - LEARNING POINT: Good software starts with solid data modeling. This helps prevent future refactoring.

2. **Command Line Argument Processing**
   - WHY: We need to parse user commands before we can do anything else
   - HOW:
     * Parse arguments to identify the command (add/update/delete/etc.)
     * Extract additional parameters (task descriptions, IDs)
     * Validate input before processing
   - LEARNING POINT: Command processing is a common pattern in CLI apps. It's similar to how Git and other CLI tools work.

3. **File Operations Foundation**
   - WHY: All data persistence depends on file operations
   - HOW:
     * Create functions to read the JSON file
     * Handle file creation if it doesn't exist
     * Create functions to write/update the JSON file
     * Implement error handling for file operations
   - LEARNING POINT: File I/O is fundamental to many applications. Proper error handling is crucial.

4. **Core Task Operations**
   - WHY: These are the basic CRUD operations for our tasks
   - HOW:
     * Implement add task functionality
     * Implement update task functionality
     * Implement delete task functionality
   - LEARNING POINT: CRUD operations are the backbone of most applications. They follow similar patterns across different projects.

5. **Status Management**
   - WHY: Tasks need to transition between states
   - HOW:
     * Implement status change functionality
     * Ensure proper timestamp updates
     * Validate status transitions
   - LEARNING POINT: State management is a key concept in software development.

6. **List/Filter Operations**
   - WHY: Users need different views of their tasks
   - HOW:
     * Implement generic list functionality
     * Add filtering by status
     * Sort tasks appropriately
   - LEARNING POINT: Data filtering and presentation are common requirements in applications.

7. **Error Handling & Edge Cases**
   - WHY: Robust applications need to handle unexpected situations
   - HOW:
     * Handle invalid task IDs
     * Handle file permission issues
     * Handle invalid JSON data
     * Implement user feedback for errors
   - LEARNING POINT: Error handling makes the difference between fragile and robust applications.

8. **User Feedback & Output Formatting**
   - WHY: Users need clear feedback about their actions
   - HOW:
     * Design consistent output formats
     * Implement success/error messages
     * Format task listings for readability
   - LEARNING POINT: Good UX is important even in CLI applications.

**REMEMBER FOR IMPLEMENTATION:**
1. Start with the simplest operation (probably 'add') and get it working end-to-end
2. Use manual testing with the file system before moving to the next feature
3. Keep functions small and focused - each should do one thing well
4. Consider making helper functions for common operations
5. Test edge cases as you go - don't wait until the end

Let's design a clean and logical folder structure that will make the project maintainable and easy to understand. I'll explain the reasoning behind each part.

1. **Root Project Directory**
   - WHY: Main project folder that contains everything
   ```
   task-tracker/
   ```

2. **Source Code Organization**
   ```
   task-tracker/
   ├── src/               # Source code directory
   │   ├── commands/      # Command implementations
   │   ├── utils/         # Utility functions
   │   └── main.py        # Entry point
   ```
   - WHY: Separating code into logical directories makes it easier to find things
   - HOW:
     * `commands/` will contain one file per command (add.py, update.py, etc.)
     * `utils/` will have shared functionality like file operations
     * `main.py` orchestrates everything

3. **Data Storage**
   ```
   task-tracker/
   ├── data/              # Data directory
   │   └── tasks.json     # Task storage file
   ```
   - WHY: Keeping data separate from code is a best practice
   - HOW: Create this directory if it doesn't exist when the program runs

4. **Tests (Optional but Recommended)**
   ```
   task-tracker/
   ├── tests/             # Test directory
   │   ├── test_commands/ # Command tests
   │   └── test_utils/    # Utility tests
   ```
   - WHY: Organized tests help ensure code quality
   - HOW: Mirror the src/ structure in tests/

5. **Documentation and Configuration**
   ```
   task-tracker/
   ├── README.md          # Project documentation
   ├── requirements.txt   # Project dependencies (if any)
   └── .gitignore        # Git ignore file
   ```
   - WHY: Good documentation helps others (and future you) understand the project

Complete structure:
```
task-tracker/
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── add.py
│   │   ├── update.py
│   │   ├── delete.py
│   │   ├── list.py
│   │   └── mark.py
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── file_operations.py
│   │   └── validators.py
│   └── main.py
├── data/
│   └── tasks.json
├── tests/
│   ├── test_commands/
│   │   └── test_add.py
│   └── test_utils/
│       └── test_file_operations.py
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── .gitignore
```

**Key Files and Their Purposes:**

1. `src/main.py`:
   - Entry point for the application
   - Handles command-line argument parsing
   - Routes to appropriate command handlers

2. `src/commands/*.py`:
   - Each file handles one command type
   - Keeps code modular and easy to maintain
   - Makes it easy to add new commands later

3. `src/utils/file_operations.py`:
   - Contains all JSON file handling logic
   - Provides consistent interface for data access
   - Handles file creation, reading, and writing
   - Manages error handling for file operations

4. `src/utils/validators.py`:
   - Input validation functions
   - Data format checking
   - Common validation utilities

5. `data/tasks.json`:
   - Stores all task data
   - Created automatically if it doesn't exist
   - Should be in a consistent, well-defined format

**Best Practices to Follow:**

1. **Modularity**
   - Each command should be in its own file
   - Utils should be grouped by function
   - Makes code easier to test and maintain

2. **Imports**
   - Use relative imports within the project
   - Keep import statements organized
   - Consider creating `__init__.py` files to make imports cleaner

3. **Configuration**
   - Store any configuration values (like file paths) in a central location
   - Make paths relative to the project root

4. **Development Process**
   1. Start with the basic structure
   2. Implement one command at a time
   3. Add tests as you go
   4. Refactor common code into utils
   5. Document as you build
